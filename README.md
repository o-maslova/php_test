## What is it about?

This is simple html-form which let to create the png-formated image with some circles on it.

The user need to enter image width, heigth, circle radius and also amounts of circles (5, 10, 20, 50).

Then the center of each circle will be randomly defined as well as the circles' color. So when you update the page you will always see new image.
